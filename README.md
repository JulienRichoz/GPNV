## Use app in "Test Mode"
In order to use the site, an add-on able to modify HTTP Header is needed.
Here is some add-ons for the most used browsers :
 - Mozilla Firefox : https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/modify-headers/?src=search
 - Google Chrome : https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modify-headers-for-google/innpjfdalfhpcoinfnehdnbkglpmogdi

## Deployment
> Note: make sure you have the credentials to access the different services

The website is hosted on swisscenter center.
Here is the link for the managing panel: https://apanel.swisscenter.com/login

The web server does not have any cli, so a `composer install` or `composer update`
to make sure that all the dependencies are installed.
Once it's done, that the '.htaccess' file in root and 'public' folder have to
be edited. The lines which start with 'php_value' must be remove.

Also make sure that the .env file has the right database credentials (DB_HOST, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD )

When all those things are done, the website can be upload on the server by ftp.
